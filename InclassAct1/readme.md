Checkpoint 4: When zoom in the image, checkpoint 2 image display more details (more pixels) than checkpoint 3 image
Checkpoint 6: checkpoint 5 image has the higher light (gamma value> 1) than checkpoint 2 image. When we increase gamma value the image become bright and dark if we decrease the gamma value

Following questions:

1. Light can be reflected, transmitted, refracted, absorted, scattered, diffracted when it hits different objects with different materials. 
    Example: Human is able to see objects with color (Light hits that object then reflect again with that color to our eyes)
             Human can see through glass (Light is transmitted through that material, sometimes can see the image of ourself because of the small reflection of light of that glass)
             Refraction happens when the material bend the light (We put the long stick into the pool and we can see that stick is bended but it is not truly bended. It's just because the water bends the direction of the light and reflection)
             
2. Light is made up of multiple wavelengths. For example: We can see the red color of an object because that object does not absort the wavelength (that corresponding to red color) and reflect back to our eyes. Color of an object depends (to our eyes) is the wavelength that object cannot absorb and reflect back to us.

3. Whenever we need to model a new color, using YUV color space helps up to save more memory and reduce processing time more than RGB.
4. Whenever we add more light color, it will become brighter to the point it will become white light (if we add all 7 ligh colors), but the paint color is different. If we add more different paint colors, it will become darker to the point of black color. For white color RGB values will be (255,255,255), black color RGB values (0,0,0)
5. The digital camera filter lens has the number of green squares higher than blue and red. Therefore, whenever the green color reflects back to the camera, it can be easily filtered and seperated out.
6. Tone mapping is the technique using in the digital image that modify the tonal color of each pixel in the image. So that it can be displayed clearly with full details of the image. It can make the image look more realistic because of the clear seperation of the object in the image thanks to the color of the pixel in the border of different objects.
7. The relationship between wavelength and color of light is based on the reflectance rate of each corresponding color. For examplem, color red has the highest wavelength because it most likely reflect back the most to our eyes ( we can easily see the red color, including the lack of light situation ). Purple color has the lowest wavelength, because it has the lowest reflectance rate (we cannot see the purple color in the lack of light situation).
