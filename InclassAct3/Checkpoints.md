Checkpoint 2.2: in checkpoint 2.5, the pixel value is generally higher due to the higher power of light. The power of light increase leads to the increase of irradiance. The decrease of light's power leads to the fact that the irradiance also decreases.

Checkpoint 2.4: The piture with closer light is more bright than checkpoint 1.5. As the light distance increases, the irradiance decreases.


Checkpoint 2.6: The shadow is smaller with area light and the shape is slightly changed from the original one.
